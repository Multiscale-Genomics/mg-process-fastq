# Main App Interface
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
class App(object):
    """
    The generic App interface.

    The App abstracts details of the particular local execution environment
    in order for Tools to run smoothly. For example, a subclass of App may
    exist that deals with execution of Tools in a Virtual Machine.
    Apps should be compatible with all Tools.

    In general, App deals with:

    1) instantiate and configure the Tool,
    2) call its "run" method and
    3) deal with errors

    The App.launch() method is called in order to run a Tool within the App,
    with each call wrapping a single Tool class. The App.launch method calls
    the Tool.run() method; the App._pre_run() and App._post_run() methods
    should be called to execute operations before and after, in order to
    facilitate the accumulation of features in App subclasses in a way similar
    to the mixin pattern (see for example WorkflowApp).

    The App must check for errors in Tool execution and take the necessary
    actions to report the errors to the caller. Since Tools may generally be
    executed on separate machines, the Exceptions are passed by the Tools in
    the Metadata (see Metadata.set_exception). The App._error_report() method
    should be called to report errors.

    As Apps need to be compatible with any Tool, it is unpractical to use Apps
    to combine Tools. Instead, Workflows can be implemented (see Workflow) in
    order to take advantage of the VRE's capabilities to optimise the data flow
    according to the specific requirements of the workflow, by ensuring that
    data is staged/unstaged only once.

    This general interface outlines the App's workload, independent of the
    execution environment and runtime used (e.g. it does not rely on PyCOMPSs,
    see PyCOMPSsApp).

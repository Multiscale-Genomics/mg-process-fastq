# Main App Interface
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class App(object):

    """
    The generic App interface.

    The App is the main entry point to the tools layer of the VRE. The App
    abstracts details of the particular local execution environment in order
    for Tools to run smoothly. For example, a subclass of App may exist that
    deals with execution of Tools in a Virtual Machine, without file-system
    access to the VRE, using COMPSs. Apps should be compatible with all Tools.

    In general, App deals with:

    1) retrieve and stage the inputs required by the Tool,
    3) instantiate and configure the Tool,
    3) call its "run" method,
    4) deal with errors, and
    5) finally unstage its outputs.

    The App.launch() method is called in order to run a Tool within the App,
    with each call wrapping a single Tool class. The App.launch method calls
    the Tool.run() method; the App._pre_run() and App._post_run() methods should
    be called to execute operations before and after, in order to facilitate the
    accumulation of features in App subclasses in a way similar to the mixin
    pattern (see for example WorkflowApp). 

    The App must check for errors in Tool execution and take the necessary
    actions to report the errors to the caller. Since Tools may generally be
    executed on separate machines, the Exceptions are passed by the Tools in the
    Metadata (see Metadata.set_exception). The App._error_report() method should
    be called to report errors.

    As Apps need to be compatible with any Tool, it is unpractical to use Apps
    to combine Tools. Instead, Workflows can be implemented (see Workflow) in
    order to take advantage of the VRE's capabilities to optimise the data flow
    according to the specific requirements of the workflow, by ensuring that
    data is staged/unstaged only once.

    This general interface outlines the App's workload, independent of the
    execution environment and runtime used (e.g. it does not rely on PyCOMPSs,
    see PyCOMPSsApp). Subclasses of App should implement operations specific to
    the local execution environment, such as staging/unstaging.

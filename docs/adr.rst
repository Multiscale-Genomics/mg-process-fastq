Architectural Design Record
===========================

2017-08-15 - Implementation of pigz
-----------------------------------

It was highlighted that the archival step using the python module tarfile was taking a long time when archiving and compressing large volumes of data. This is an issue in the WGBS pipeline where the FASTQ files are broken down into small sections and are then aligned individually.

The issue was in relation to the compression step. tar, and therefore tarfile, runs as a single process. In linear time to compress a 14GB file takes 18 minutes, which is a long time for the user that have to wait. The archival step is less than 1 min. As a result the compression has moved to using `pigz <https://zlib.net/pigz/>`_ after the archival step to perform the compression in a parallel fashion across all available cores on a machine. On a 4 core machine this allowed the compression of the same file to take only 7 min.

The resultant compressed file remains accessible via gzip. After decompression files have the same structure, so this should be an invisible change.


2018-01-26 - Disable no-self-use for @tasks
-------------------------------------------

The disabling of pylint test for determining if a function should be a static method was made as this affected the behaviour of pycompss preventing it from functioning correctly. As a result all @task functions do not require the no-self-use test to be run.


2018-02-28 - BAM Merge Strategy
-------------------------------

Based on benchmarking of the pipeline the procedure for merging of bam files has been modified to get an optimal balance between running as much as possible in parallel vs the cost of spinning up new jobs to perform the merging. It was found that running each job merging 10 files provided the break even point between the cost of creating a new job and getting the maximum throughput through the system. It also reduces the number of iterative merge procedures which is beneficial when there are alignments that are difficult to merge.

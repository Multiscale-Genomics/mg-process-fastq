Architectural Design Record

2017-08-15 - Implementation of pigz
-----------------------------------

It was highlighted that the archival step using the python module tarfile was taking a long time when archiving and compressing large volumes of data. This is an issue in the WGBS pipeline where the FASTQ files are broken down into small sections and are then aligned individually.

The issue was in relation to the compression step. tar, and therefore tarfile, runs as a single process. In linear time to compress a 14GB file takes 18 minutes, which is a long time for teh user that have to wait. The archival step is less than 1 min. As a result the compression has moved to using `pigz <https://zlib.net/pigz/>`_ after the archival step to perform the compression in a parallel fashion across all available cores on a machine. On a 4 core machine this allowed the compression of the same file to take only 7 min.

The resultant compressed file remains accessible via gzip. After decompression files have the same structure, so this should be an invisible change.
